The ICML 2024 workshop on Aligning Reinforcement Learning Experimentalists and Theorists will feature a poster session devoted to presenting ideas, positions, and open challenges. The papers should be related to bridging the gap between experimental and theoretical reinforcement learning (see [CfP link] for the range of topics) and should include:
- A clear definition of the problem/idea/position.
- The motivation for studying the problem/idea/position and why it is important for the machine learning community.
- The current state of the problem/idea/position.

The submitted papers can either be problems/ideas/positions novel to the community, or problems/ideas/positions already proposed in published works.
Submitted papers will be reviewed by the program committee. All accepted papers will have a poster presentation. Please note that at least one author of each accepted paper must be available for the poster and/or oral presentation. There will be no proceedings.

<h2>Submission instructions</h2>

The page limit is 4 pages (excluding references and the appendix). Submissions may include supplementary material, but reviewers are only required to read the first 4 pages. Submissions should use the template in this LaTeX style file. The title should start with "Open Problem:", ”Idea:”, or ”Position:”. The reviewing process is double-blind, so the submissions should be anonymized and should not contain information that could identify the authors. Parallel submissions (to a journal, conference, workshop, or preprint repository) are allowed.
